# Lost In The Dungeon!
> Final project for Object Oriented Programming class

This is a text based adventure game! You awake to find your self in a dungeon (how? don't worry about that part) and now you wonder the dungeon trying to find your way to the surface. 

The final project in this class, you can see the requirements 
[here](Readme%20Files/final_project.pdf)
, aimed to force us to create an app that takes full advanced of OOP principles. Concepts like abstraction, Design patterns, and polymorphism are all covered in this project. But instead of making an *"adult"* banking software to cover all these concepts, They are covered in a fun text based adventure!
